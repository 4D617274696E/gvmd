OpenVAS Manager
===============

The OpenVAS Manager aims to be a layer between OpenVAS-Client and
the actual OpenVAS Server. Basically it should be responsible for
any tasks where no high system privileges are required.

This module is in an early development stage.
At the current state OpenVAS Manager is a protocol logger for OTP.

It is not mandatory to have OpenVAS Manager for using OpenVAS 1.0 or 2.0.
