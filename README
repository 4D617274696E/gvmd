The OpenVAS Manager aims to be a layer between OpenVAS-Client and the
actual OpenVAS Server.  Basically it should be responsible for any tasks
where no high system privileges are required.

This module is in an early stage of development.

It is not mandatory to have OpenVAS Manager for using OpenVAS 1.0 or 2.0.


Howto use
---------

For example, if openvasd is running on port 7772, the following command
starts the Manager on port 1241.  The client can then connect to port 1241
as though it was connecting to openvasd.

    openvasmd --port 1241 --sport 7772

A command like

	openvasmd --sport 7772 --update

will update the Manager's NVT cache, and then exit.

There are some tests under src/tests.  To run them, start your openvasmd,
for example with

    openvasmd   --port 1242 --sport 9390

then set the environment variables for the user and password

    export OPENVAS_TEST_USER=user_created_by_openvas-adduser
    export OPENVAS_TEST_PASSWORD=that_users_password

and then run all the tests

    make test

or any one of the tests, for example

	src/test/omp_get_report_0
