The OpenVAS Manager aims to be a layer between OpenVAS-Client and the
actual OpenVAS Server.  Basically it should be responsible for any tasks
where no high system privileges are required.

This module is in an early stage of development.

It is not mandatory to have OpenVAS Manager for using OpenVAS 1.0 or 2.0.


Howto use
---------

For example, if openvasd is running on port 7772, the following command
starts the manager on port 1241.  The client can then connect to port 1241
as though it was connecting to openvasd.

    openvasmd --port 1241 --sport 7772
