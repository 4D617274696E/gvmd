.SH NAME
openvasmd \- Manager daemon of the Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBopenvasmd OPTIONS
\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
OpenVAS Scanner, openvassd(8), acts as a service and offers a communication protocol for its clients called OTP. The core task of the OpenVAS Scanner is the actual scan process. 

The OpenVAS Manager is a OTP client and adds various management functionalities to handle and organise scan results. Thus OpenVAS Manager acts as a layer between the OpenVAS Scanner and its own clients (for example omp(8), gsad(8) or gsd(8)) which connect via the OMP protocol to the OpenVAS Manager. 

A related service is OpenVAS Administrator, openvasad(8) which among other tasks also manages user accounts for OpenVAS.
