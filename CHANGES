openvas-manager 0.5.0 (2009-05-08)

This is the first public release of the openvas-manager module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS).

The OpenVAS Manager aims to be a layer between OpenVAS-Client and
the actual OpenVAS Server. Basically it should be responsible for
any tasks where no high system privileges are required.

This module is in an early development stage and not yet intended for
production use.

It is not mandatory to have OpenVAS Manager for using OpenVAS 1.0 or 2.0.

Usage example:
If openvasd is running on port 7772, the following command starts the manager
on port 1241.  The client can then connect to port 1241 as though it was
connecting to openvasd.

# openvasmd --port 1241 --sport 7772

More information about the command line arguments can be obtained using:

# openvasmd --help
